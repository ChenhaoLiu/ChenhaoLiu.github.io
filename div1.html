    Contour extraction is a key topic in computer vision, especially in topics related to object recognition and multi-view applications. In order to <br>
    extract curve fragments, which contains chains of ordered edge points, from images, we propose a multi-stage approach to curve extraction where the <br>
    curve fragment search space is iteratively reduced by removing unlikely candidates using geometric constrains, but without affecting recall, to a <br>
    point where the application of an objective functional becomes appropriate. The process progresses in stages from local to global: (i) edges, (ii) curvelets, <br>
    (iii) unambiguous curve fragments, (iv) resolving ambiguities to generate a full set of curve fragment candidates, (v) merging curve fragments based <br>
    on a learned photometric and geometric cues as well a novel lateral edge sparsity cue, and (vi) the application of a learned objective functional to <br>
    get a final selection of curve fragments. The process of our approach is shown in the figure below.<br>

    In the process of contour extraction, we try to resolve ambiguity of contours by group remaining edges. The first step is to construct a graph of all <br>
    possible groupings, which is called a Hypothesis Graph. We define an energy function of contours and divide the Hypothesis Graph into hundreds <br>
    of connected components for efficiency. A typical area of Hypothesis Graph is shown in the figure below, where the dashed lines are hypotheses.

    In each connect component, Dijkstra's algorithm is used to build a shortest path tree between each pair of nodes to link under the energy function. <br>
    Then the paths are ranked by their energy, then we add each path by its rank while avoiding overlap. After all connected components are solved, <br>
    our system move on to detect and link junctions to form a complete contour fragment graph, using a priority queue. The input and output of <br>
    ambiguity resolving stage are compared below.
