I am currently affiliated to [3D Image lab](3dimage.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn), under the guidance of [Prof. Huimin Ma](http://3dimage.ee.tsinghua.edu.cn/mhm). In summer 2016, I spent six wonderful weeks working as an intern in <a href = \"http://vision.lems.brown.edu/\">LEMS Lab, Brown University</a>, working with <a href = \"http://vision.lems.brown.edu/faculty/kimia\">Prof. Benjamin Kimia</a>. During my undergraduate study in Tsinghua University, I got an overall GPA of 86/100, ranking 32 among 196 students. I was active in research activities having been recruited by Tsinghua University's Student Research Training program and Top Open program. I have done several research related to computer vision and data science, and I now have three publications under revision. My research interest spans a wide range in the field of computer vision, especially in topics related to object detection, scene labeling, face analysis, and image analysis method for the above topics, such as contour extraction, image segmentation and motion detection. My dream is to make AI devices interpret visual world as accurately and efficiently as human beings.
